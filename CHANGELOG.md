# Changelog

This changelog documents all notable user-facing changes of the Tenzir 
Component Library.

Every entry has a category for which we use the following visual abbreviations:

- 🎁 Feature
- 🧬 Experimental Feature
- ⚠️  Change
- ⚡️ Breaking Change
- 🐞 Bugfix

## [0.12.0]
- 🎁 Tabs [#81](https://github.com/tenzir/ui-component-library/pull/81)
We now have a tabs, and tabbed card component. They have built-in support for
drag 'n drop replacing, updating, adding, duplicating and removing. Depending
on which callback functions are supplied, they're activated, or not.

## [0.10.0]
- 🎁 Sizing [#71](https://github.com/tenzir/ui-component-library/pull/71)
We now support sizes (`small` / `medium` / `large`) for buttons and alerts

## [0.9.0]
- 🎁 Generalized Segments [#67](https://github.com/tenzir/ui-component-library/pull/67)
Instead of using strings as identifiers, the segments now use a generic type.
Making them type-safe using variants is now possible.

- ⚠️  Better font scaling [#67](https://github.com/tenzir/ui-component-library/pull/67)
Font-scaling was previously done using css transforms. But that broke when using
it in button-groups. By using paddings, we can still use different sizes,
but they no longer break in groups.

## [0.8.1]
- 🐞 Tooltip Hover [#60](https://github.com/tenzir/ui-component-library/pull/60)
The tooltip was included in the hover's bounding box of the element. The 
`pointer-events` are now disabled for hover events until they become visible, 
meaning it can only be activated by hovering the element upon which the tooltip
is introduced, not the tooltip itself.

## [0.8.0]
- 🧬 Tooltips [#59](https://github.com/tenzir/ui-component-library/pull/59)
We've used a CSS only approach for tooltips that is reasonably flexible in terms
of positioning. We'll test this internally before releasing it publicly.
